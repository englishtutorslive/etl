          Short and Intensive online english classes (25 Min) which conform to your busy schedule Because all lessons require no travel time, you can enjoy shorter classes and/or greater frequency. Shorter classes mean each class is fully maximised and is free from time-wasting activities (unlike traditional classroom lessons of 1-2 hours). And because each class is only 25 minutes, depending on your needs, you can choose to take class 2 or 3 times a week, without significant cost. And of course if you require it, 50 minute classes are also available.
