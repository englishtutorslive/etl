# English Tutors Live
## The mission:
###### The goal is simple. We want to give everyone the opportunity to learn English anywhere in the world- on their own time.

## Why?
Language learning is something that our team is very passionate about. Learning a new language is an invaluable experience that broadens horizons and changes lives. Who wouldn't want to help give people that gift, while creating jobs for suitable teachers.

## How?
 English Tutors Live is a platform built with Ruby on Rails that connects students that want to learn English, with teachers that can tutor them over Skype. It allows students and teachers to create profiles, and students to request teachers based on their specializations, interests, and availability. It allows teachers and students to track learning, by allowing teachers to send class notes, and homework to current students through the site.

## What's next?
- Introduce a rating system for teachers for quality assurance.
- Create a booking system in which allows students to book lessons with their teachers based on teacher availability.
- Implement Stripe in order for students to pay for their lessons through the site.
- English is only the beginning. We fully intend on branching out into as many languages as we can.
